# EM797 Connecting Humans: Networks, History and Social Media

**Instructor: Dr. Chris Chao Su  
Teaching Assistant: Tiernan Cahill**

This repository contains sample data and example code for the EM797 course at Boston University, updated for the Summer I 2021 term. 

## Course Overview
This course introduces concepts, methods, and applications of network science and prepares students to develop a working knowledge of network analysis. The course will review scholarship on the science of networks in communication, computer science, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, in order to take an in-depth look at theories, methods, and tools to examine the structure and dynamics of networks. Students will gain a modest understanding as to why network analysis is a highly distributed field where no single software application covers all the active research on social networks.
