# Loading Data and Required Packages
We will again be importing the graph objects to be used in this analysis from the serialized RDS format.

We will also need to load a few packages for this lab:

  - `dplyr` for wrangling data
  - `igraph` for modelling and visualizing our network
  - `statnet` for additional inferential analysis tools

```{r load, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(statnet)
```

```{r data-processing}
```
