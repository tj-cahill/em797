# Loading Data and Required Packages
Rather than having to re-convert the raw data from Brandwatch into a graph object, we can serialize the existing graph objects from Lab 1 and import them directly into our environment here.

We will also need to load a few packages for this lab:

  - `magrittr` for handling pipes and enabling tidy workflows
  - `igraph` for modelling and visualizing our network

```{r load, message = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(igraph)

mention_graph <- readRDS("../data/mention_graph.RDS")
htag_graph <- readRDS("../data/htag_graph.RDS")
htag_uses_graph <- readRDS("../data/htag_uses_graph.RDS")
```
