# Loading Data and Required Packages
We will again be importing the graph objects to be used in this analysis from the serialized RDS format.

We will also need to load a few packages for this lab:

  - `dplyr` for wrangling data
  - `igraph` for modelling and visualizing our network

```{r load, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(igraph)
library(assortnet)

mention_graph <- readRDS("../data/mention_graph.RDS")
htag_graph <- readRDS("../data/htag_graph.RDS")
htag_uses_graph <- readRDS("../data/htag_uses_graph.RDS")
```
